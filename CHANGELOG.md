## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

First pre-release: the alarm core with Apple HomeKit support. The graphical setup in the side panel follows in a later version.

### Added

- **Alarm system as entity:** an `alarm_control_panel` with the modes "Home" and "Away", optionally "Night" (off by default), exit delay per mode, entry delay for chosen sensors (for example the front door) and alarm duration (0 = until disarmed).
- **Several alarm systems:** one entry per alarm system, each with its own device. Names must be unique.
- **Apple HomeKit:** works with the HomeKit Bridge of Home Assistant. Apple Home offers "Home", "Away", "Off" and, with night mode on, "Night". Tested with the real HomeKit Bridge.
- **Zones:** one entity per zone, on as soon as a sensor of the zone is open.
- **Open sensor when arming:** block arming or bypass the open sensors until disarmed.
- **Code:** optional, 4 to 8 digits, stored only as a hash, optionally also required to arm. Locked for one minute after five wrong codes. The default code from the entity settings of Home Assistant is supported.
- **Restart:** state, delays and alarm continue after a restart or when the options change. An entry delay that ran out during the restart becomes an alarm. A sensor that comes back from "unavailable" as open does not trigger.
- **Languages:** English and German.
